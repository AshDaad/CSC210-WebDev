        <p>The Void Designer was inspired by four students in the City of Salt Lake,
        		trying to decide on a very important decision. Most likely the most important
        		decision they will have ever made... The Intro to Web Final. Silence was maintained 
        		within the vicinity of the four students, then AshDaad broke the Silence by giving the 
        		first description of what would shortly be named the &quot;Void Designer&quot;.
      	</p>
        		
        <p>The group unanimously agreed a product such as the Void should have a pedestal 
        		to be showcased on. It was agreed that a website would be constructed, designed, and
        		made specifically for the greatness that is &quot;Void Designer&quot;
