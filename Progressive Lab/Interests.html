            <h1 id="title">Interest, Oh Boy!</h1>

            <h3 id="underTitle">So what are my interests..</h3>
            <p><span class="theBegining">M</span>y interests mainly of video games, anime, manga, and what typical will be going on in my life for either the next week or the current week and projects that need to be completed. I like to try to have an easy time with somethings and being able to figure how I can spread things out over courses of time is nice. It makes my life easer...usually.</p>

            <h3>The actual Intrests</h3>
            <p>Like I stated before I typically like Video games, like puzzle games, first person shooters like Payday 2, where there is some strategyin how you go about robbing or stealing your target. Co-op games are one of my favorites because not only do I get to play with my friends, but it also takes cooperation to actually make it through some of those games. Anime has been one of my first interestsever because I was watching anime before I even got my first video game. I have let into my life for so long I basically let it take a hold of me and turn me into a weeb. But whateves it's cool. Same goes for mangas.

            </p>
            <p>Another interestsof mine is, well to say it short, messing around with computers. Shocking Right!? Bet you didn't see that coming. I basically like to toyaround with computers and just about everything about them. I enjoyed taking them apart and changing the hardware. In highschool me and a friend, while acting as a teachers TA, were told to reinstall windows 7 on more than 130 refurbishedlaptops for the school and I found that the process was somewhat tedious but enjoyable. Messing around with software on a computer is pretty fun to! There is this one program called rainmeter and with it you can make some really cool things. I have wanted to learn the coding language to try to make my own application but it has been a little time-consuming and I haven't has the time to take a step.</p>

            <h3>Lastly...</h3>
            <p>I'm not quite sure what kind of data was, is or could go into the table as "data" for interests are so I just made a little photo set of little anime manga characters. It still shows that I know that I know a thing or two about tables right..?</p>
