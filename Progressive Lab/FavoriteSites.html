            <h3>Reasoning</h3>
            <p><span class="theBegining">M</span>y reasoning behinf my choices are pretty simple and are mainly based on the average time that I usually catch myself on one of these sites. Fisrt off, the reason twitch is number 1 should be pretty obvious, it's twitch, I wouldn't be here with out it. </p>

            <p>Youtube is number 2 on my list because I tend to watch videos a lot and that is where I tend to find and listen to my music playlists as well, because lets face it, I'm not gonna go and buy all of the songs I listen to. That's a lot of money.</p>
