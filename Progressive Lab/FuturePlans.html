            <p><span class="theBegining">A</span>t the moment I am not completely sure of what it is that I am looking towards for my future. I know of a small long term-ish goal of getting better at typing, being faster, more accurate, and most importantl being able to type without looking at the keyboard or my hands. Thats a big thing I want. I guess I woulw like to get these projects out of my hair as well. I have a somewhat big project in OOP and it seems like i coud be a doozy.</p>

            <h3>Outlook...within school carrer</h3>
            <p>As for school related outlooks, I am waiting to get either farther into web and networking to choose my degree, but I am thinking of going towards either webdev or IS. I likeed the hardware part about computers when I was in certain classes in highschool but the actual networking may throw me off, and webdev seems like it would be fun as well.</p>
